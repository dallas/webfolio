[ ] make a PLAN!
[x] need two globe instances so we can move the background images and dissolve between the two
[x] use jQuery to change the background-position on both elements
[x] use jQuery to change the opacity setting
[ ] use CSS to transition on opacity (when available)
[ ] fallback to jQuery for the opacity change
[ ] check support in Safari, Firefox, and IE (and Opera?)
